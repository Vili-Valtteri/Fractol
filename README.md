# Fractol

Fractol is a project that explores the world of fractals by creating visual representations of the Mandelbrot set, Julia sets, and Barnsley Fern.

## Prerequisites

- A MacOS-based operating system
- GCC Compiler

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Vili-Valtteri/Fractol.git fractol

2. Change your working directory to the project directory:

cd fractol

3. Compile the project:

make

4. Run the executable:

./fractol [fractal name]

Replace `[fractal name]` with one of the following options to choose the fractal you want to visualize:

- `mandelbrot` for the Mandelbrot set
- `julia` for a Julia set
- `barnsley` for the Barnsley Fern
